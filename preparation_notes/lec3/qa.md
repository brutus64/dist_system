How does VM FT handle network partitions? That is, is it possible that if the primary and the backup end up in different network partitions that the backup will become a primary too and the system will run with two primaries?

- It does this with 2 ways, it uses test and set lock and output rule. The split-brain issue with 2 primaries is avoided with the mechanism of test and set lock where only 1 VM can hold the lock on the shared disk, the VM being the ```primary VM```. In a network partition, if the primary can still reach the shared disk, the backup cannot acquire the lock since the primary still has it and thus cannot become the new primary. In the case that the primary cannot reach the shared disk, the backup will detect that and take the lock and "go live". This way only 1 primary is relevant. Expanding on if the old primary lost its connection to the shared disk, it will still do its own computation but when it tries to output anything, it must be ACKed first by its backup, but the backup is now the new primary, so it will never ACK it, making the old primary do useless computation and never output it, while the backup or new primary probably has a new backup configured for it afterwards. The shared disk is the single source of truth since both primary/backup have access to it and is used for coordination/ownership of being a primary with the lock mechanism, all the data transfer is through the logging channel, never the disk.
