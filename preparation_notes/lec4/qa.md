ith a linearizable key/value storage system, could two clients who issue get() requests for the same key at the same time receive different values? Explain why not, or how it could occur.

- Yes, this can actually occur, because when you request keys at the same time, it doesn't mean the request is actually invoked by the application program until some time between the request and response (invocation point). What can actually happen is a one of the get request goes through and returns 0 but a put request that was actually issued later than the gets can actually get processed before the 2nd get or anywhere in between the invocation of both gets and result in the 2nd get returning a 1, because concurrent operations can overlap in time and invocation can occur anytime between its request and response. Requesting the same key at the same time does not guarantee same values because a client request does not guarantee that the program will respond to it in the same order the client request whether it is due to some network delay, or the invocation timing. All linearizability guarantees is that all clients observe a consistent truth of 1 global ordering that respects real time, the operations themselves can occur in real-time anytime between its request and response, and its this variance and non-determinism that allows 2 get requests to get diff values despite being requested at the same time.
